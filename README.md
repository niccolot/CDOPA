# CDOPA

The aim of the project is to build a binary CNN that classifies between positive/negative parkinson diagnosis based on PET scan.

Carbidopa marker (CDOPA) reacts with the base gangli in the brain, resulting in a bright region in the PET scans. Depending on the presence of parkinson the cdopa reacts differently, the cnn classifies the scan based on this difference.
